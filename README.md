- Research project(s) exploring different techniques used to achieve QRcode exploitation (QUISHING):

### Main research:
- Exploiting AI-agentic browsers to read information off a webpage and execute hidden instructions. In this case the QR code is designed to unpack a set of instructions requesting the AI to exfiltrate data from a given source; a webpage, an account, a platform or a service where it has access.

### Other research:
- Common attack vectors to investigate and analyse are physics QR codes to distribute malware such as Coper/Octo2; mimicking legit apps but thus far no zero-click auto-download  
- Rare attack vector includes scanner app flaws allowing RCE post-scann, but these were patched via app/OS updates (such as older Android QR readers). No widespread OS-level QR exploits.
